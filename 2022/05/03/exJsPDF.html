    <p>
        Reading is probably one of the most beneficial and feasible activities that a man can do.
        It is through reading that a person is going to be able to discover new ideas, concepts, places, and people.
        Some people even describe reading as a journey that starts as the opening of a page, and finishes as the last
        page is turned.
        The reason why reading is so important is because reading is relaxing to our mind and soul; it is a way for
        children to reach out to the world,
        and it improves our thinking process.
